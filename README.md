# IonXApiFramework

IonXApiFramework is a Php framework created to help you build secured and flexible api for your projects.
It's built above doctrine for database management and another project of mine JacksonPhp for Json>Object mapping.


It's a framework thought to be simple, very much like Express for JavaScript (still I try :)).


You set the config parameters, create a route object tree, and call "new IonXApi(route)".
In fact you also have to create .htaccess to relay request to your main file, create entities, controllers and managers from existing class. But it's faster than you think :)

And don't forget to call cli-config to update your database scheme !


You need to download doctrine in the /vendor/ folder to be able to use this library.

You also need to download another project of mine: JacksonPhp which is not public yet, so please be patient, it will come soon.


In fact right now this project is not ready, it's a big rethinking of an old project and it's currently WIP, so I'm sorry but you can't use it for now.

I will finish my restructuration as fast as my planning allows it :)
